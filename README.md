The project aims to classify fruits (such as banana, apple, strawberry, and orange) into ripe and unripe categories using machine learning techniques. The code utilizes image processing and deep learning algorithms to accurately classify the fruit images. The repository includes the dataset used, pre-trained models, and Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation. 
# Data 
This dataset was utilized from [`the FRINN GitHub`](https://github.com/ece324-2020/FRINN/tree/main) repository. The dataset comprises 15 subfolders containing training data in the form of PNG images. The images depict various types of fruits, such as apples, oranges, bananas, raspberries, and strawberries, each classified into three states: ripe, unripe, and rotten. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for training image recognition models, particularly in the realm of fruit classification algorithms.
# Methods
This repository presents a method for fruit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the VGG16 architecture. The goal is to build a model capable of accurately classifying different types of fruits based on their images.

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning model specifically designed for image analysis tasks. It is well-suited for tasks like fruit recognition due to its ability to automatically learn and extract meaningful features from images. CNNs consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers that extract local patterns and features, pooling layers that downsample the spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers that make predictions based on the extracted features.

In this project, we employ the VGG16 architecture, a popular CNN architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks. VGG16 is composed of 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The convolutional layers use small filters to capture detailed information, and the pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions while retaining important features. The fully connected layers at the end of the network make the final predictions based on the extracted features.

The code provided in this repository implements the CNN model with the VGG16 architecture using the PyTorch deep learning framework. It includes data loaders to load and preprocess the fruit images, a training loop that trains the model on the dataset, and an evaluation loop to assess the model's performance on a separate validation set. The code also implements early stopping to prevent overfitting and provides functions to track and visualize the training progress.
