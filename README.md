The project aims to classify fruits (such as banana, apple, strawberry, and orange) into ripe and unripe categories using machine learning techniques. The code utilizes image processing and deep learning algorithms to accurately classify the fruit images. The repository includes the dataset used, pre-trained models, and Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation. 
# Data base
This dataset was utilized from [`the FRINN GitHub`]([https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg](https://github.com/ece324-2020/FRINN/tree/main) repository. The dataset comprises 15 subfolders containing training data in the form of PNG images. The images depict various types of fruits, such as apples, oranges, bananas, raspberries, and strawberries, each classified into three states: ripe, unripe, and rotten. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for training image recognition models, particularly in the realm of fruit classification algorithms.
