The project aims to classify fruits (such as banana, apple, strawberry, and orange) into ripe and unripe categories using machine learning techniques. The code utilizes image processing and deep learning algorithms to accurately classify the fruit images. The repository includes the dataset used, pre-trained models, and Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation.
